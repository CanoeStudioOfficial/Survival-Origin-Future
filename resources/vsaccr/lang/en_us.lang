#tips
vsaccr.tips.2=You can throw all the new materials you’ve obtained into the smelting furnace to see if they will produce new alloys.
vsaccr.tips.3=Holding down the ~ key allows you to mine or chop trees quickly! Not only that, even stone can be mined quickly, but it will also rapidly consume tool durability and hunger.
vsaccr.tips.4=To discard items, press the / button on the numpad.
vsaccr.tips.5=The Tinkers' Construct Smeltery is a great tool for crafting alloys. If you have enough minerals, don't bother with crafting various powders. The Smeltery can directly pour mineral blocks.
vsaccr.tips.6=It’s recommended to make the Tinkers’ Construct Smeltery as large as possible.
vsaccr.tips.3=The /dank/null is a useful item; you no longer have to worry about your inventory getting full while mining.
vsaccr.tips.4=If you're too lazy to build a house, you can search for villages or use the "@Prefab" command in HEI to instantly construct houses!
vsaccr.tips.5=Remember to place a Waystone near the End Portal; it’s very useful.
vsaccr.tips.6=When building roads or structures in the air, the first-person perspective is more convenient for maneuvering.
vsaccr.tips.7=When the difficulty increases, the bosses' health doesn't rise too much. Keep in mind that the health of some bosses remains fixed.
vsaccr.tips.8=Endless Blocks can be used as Beacon bases!
vsaccr.tips.9=You can input "@FTBQuests" in the HEI menu to see some items that can help you with your tasks!
vsaccr.tips.10=Have you not obtained the Endless Blocks yet? What a pity.
